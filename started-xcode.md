In order to compile our own software, we need to install [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/) — Apple's development environment for Mac OS X. Xcode is available as a free [download](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090) from the [Mac App Store](http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/). Don't forget to perform a **Software Update** afterwards to update everything to their latest versions.

Once you have Xcode installed, you are ready to begin installing your own custom built packages. To proceed, launch [Terminal](http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/all.html#terminal) from **Applications ➤ Utilities**.
