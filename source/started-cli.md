In order to compile our own software, we need to install the [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools) from Apple. This package installs the command line developer tools, as well as Mac OS X SDK frameworks and headers.

Alternatively, You could install [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/) — Apple's complete development environment for Mac OS X. Xcode is available as a [free download](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090) from the [Mac App Store](http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/).

Once you have the **Command Line Tools** installed, you are ready to begin installing your own custom built packages. To proceed, launch [Terminal](http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/all.html#terminal) from **Applications ➤ Utilities**.
