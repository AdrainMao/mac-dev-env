title: Xcode Developer Tools
---

In order to compile our own software, we need to install [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/) — Apple's development environment for Mac OS X. Xcode is available as a [free download](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090) from the [Mac App Store](http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/).

Since Xcode 4.2, a non-LLVM version of the `gcc` compiler is no longer included. This is not a problem for the majority of software you will install – including all the software in this guide – but you should be aware of the potential issues it may create. If you encounter problems, check out this [Mac OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer).

Presumably, the *Mac OS X GCC Installer* could replace Xcode entirely for our needs but this has not been tested.

Once you have Xcode installed, you are ready to begin installing your own custom built packages. To proceed, launch [Terminal](http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/all.html#terminal) from **Applications ➤ Utilities**.
